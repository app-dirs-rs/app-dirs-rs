# Moved

This is now at <https://github.com/app-dirs-rs/app_dirs2>

## This is a fork!

The original [app_dirs](https://crates.io/crates/app_dirs) crate appears essentially unmaintained
by now, so I have made this fork with the intent of making sure that it is at least maintained
and that bugs stay fixed so we can have something to rely on.  I don't intend to do any major
rearchitecting or updating, but bugs *will* get fixed and builds *will* succeed.

If you want to help maintain this, open an issue or such and we can work something out.
This is a *community-maintained project*.  If you want to help maintain it, open an issue.
Maintainers are expected to be polite, responsive and generally sane; the priority is to
keep vital infrastructure working, so there's no one-person bottleneck for this project again.

An alternative might be the [directories](https://crates.io/crates/directories) crate,
but when we have existing code that relies on this, forking `app_dirs` is easier than porting.
